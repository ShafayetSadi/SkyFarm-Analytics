**<span style="color: orange;">üåç SkyFarm Analytics</span>**

SkyFarm Analytics is an interactive tool designed to provide **real-time flood warnings**, **risk tracking**, and critical information for flood-prone areas. Using a 3D Earth model built with **Three.js**, this project visualizes flood data and alerts, helping users stay informed and prepared during flood emergencies.

This project was built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, with the goal of creating an impactful tool to monitor and mitigate flood-related risks globally.

## **<font color="skyblue">üåü Key Features</font>**

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Interactive 3D Earth Model</span>**
- Explore an interactive 3D model of the Earth with real-time flood alerts and risk zones. The model offers smooth navigation, zoom controls, and a realistic view of the planet.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Real-Time Flood Alerts</span>**
- Integrating flood monitoring APIs (such as NASA's Global Flood Monitoring System), SkyFarm Analytics provides live updates on flood warnings across the globe. Users can click on flood markers to view more detailed information about the affected regions.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Flood Risk Prediction</span>**
- Using predictive modeling, the app offers insights into potential flood risks based on current weather conditions and historical data. Visualizations include probability levels and severity indicators.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Historical Flood Data</span>**
- Users can explore past flood events to identify patterns and recurring risks in certain regions, visualized directly on the 3D Earth model.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Geolocation & Personalized Alerts</span>**
- SkyFarm Analytics offers personalized alerts based on user location. Users can enter their location or enable geolocation to receive flood updates specific to their area.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Safety Resources</span>**
- Access a comprehensive list of safety tips, emergency contacts, and evacuation routes tailored to the user‚Äôs location, to stay prepared during emergencies.

### **<span style="color: LightPink;">Mobile-Optimized</span>**
- The app is fully responsive, allowing users to access flood alerts and safety information from any device, including smartphones and tablets.
